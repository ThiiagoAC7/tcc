    abstract = {Background: With digital transformation and growing social media
                usage, kids spend considerable time on the web, especially
                watching videos on YouTube. YouTube is a source of education and
                entertainment media that has a significant impact on the skill
                improvement, knowledge, and attitudes of children. Simultaneously
                , harmful and inappropriate video content has a negative impact.
                Recently, researchers have given much attention to these issues,
                which are considered important for individuals and society. The
                proposed methods and approaches are to limit or prevent such
                threats that may negatively influence kids. These can be
                categorized into five main directions. They are video rating,
                parental control applications, analysis meta-data of videos,
                video or audio content, and analysis of user accounts. Objective:
                The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of
                the existing methods, techniques, tools, and approaches that are
                used to protect kids and prevent them from accessing
                inappropriate content on YouTube videos. Methods: This study
                conducts a systematic review of research papers that were
                published between January 2016 and December 2022 in international
                journals and international conferences, especially in IEEE Xplore
                Digital Library, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, Google
                Scholar, Springer database, and ScienceDirect database. Results:
                The total number of collected articles was 435. The selection and
                filtration process reduced this to 72 research articles that were
                appropriate and related to the objective. In addition, the
                outcome answers three main identified research questions.
                Significance: This can be beneficial to data mining,
                cybersecurity researchers, and peoples’ concerns about children’s
                cybersecurity and safety.},

    abstract = {Detecting communities or clusters of networks is a considerable
                interesting problem in various fields and interdisciplinary
                subjects in recent years. Tens of hundreds of methods with
                significant efforts devoted to community detection in networks,
                while an open problem in all methods is the unknown number of
                communities in real networks. It is believed that the central
                node in a community might be highly surrounded by its neighbors
                and any two centers of the community reside far from each other,
                and also believed the similarity among nodes in the same
                community is larger than the others. Therefore, the local and the
                global structures’ information shed important light on community
                detection. In this work, we present a three-stage algorithm to
                detect communities based on the local and the global information
                without giving the number of communities beforehand. The three
                stages include the central nodes identification, the label
                propagation and the communities combination. The central nodes
                are identified according to the distance between them larger than
                the average; the label propagation is to label nodes with the
                same colors when they reach to the maximum similarity; the
                communities combination is to merge two communities into one if
                the increment of the modularity is positive and maximum when the
                two communities were combined. Experiments and simulation results
                both on real world and synthetic networks show that the
                three-stage algorithm possesses well matched properties compared
                with seven other widely used algorithms, which indicates that
                three-stage algorithm can be used to detect community in social
                networks.},
