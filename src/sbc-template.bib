    abstract = {Although manipulations of visual and auditory media are as old
                as media themselves, the recent entrance of deepfakes has marked
                a turning point in the creation of fake content. Powered by the
                latest technological advances in artificial intelligence and
                machine learning, deepfakes offer automated procedures to create
                fake content that is harder and harder for human observers to
                detect. The possibilities to deceive are endless—including
                manipulated pictures, videos, and audio—and organizations must be
                prepared as this will undoubtedly have a large societal impact.
                In this article, we provide a working definition of deepfakes
                together with an overview of its underlying technology. We
                classify different deepfake types and identify risks and
                opportunities to help organizations think about the future of
                deepfakes. Finally, we propose the R.E.A.L. framework to manage
                deepfake risks: Record original content to ensure deniability,
                Expose deepfakes early, Advocate for legal protection, and
                Leverage trust to counter credulity. Following these principles,
                we hope that our society can be more prepared to counter deepfake
                tricks as we appreciate deepfake treats.},

    abstract = {There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility
                that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being.
                To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data
                set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000
                rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more
                people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades
                diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth
                rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused
                faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional
                reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences
                observed. Science, this issue p. 1146 A large-scale analysis of
                tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than
                the truth. We investigated the differential diffusion of all of
                the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter
                from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise ~126,000 stories tweeted by
                ~3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news
                as true or false using information from six independent
                fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement
                on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther,
                faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories
                of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false
                political news than for false news about terrorism, natural
                disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We
                found that false news was more novel than true news, which
                suggests that people were more likely to share novel information.
                Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in
                replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and
                trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the
                spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that
                false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots
                , are more likely to spread it.},

    abstract = {Community detection is one of the important methods for
                understanding the mechanism behind the function of social
                networks. The recently developed label propagation algorithm
                (LPA) has been gaining increasing attention because of its
                excellent characteristics, such as a succinct framework, linear
                time and space complexity, easy parallelization, etc. However,
                several limitations of the LPA algorithm, including random label
                initialization and greedy label updating, hinder its application
                to complex networks. A new parallel LPA is proposed in this
                study. First, grey relational analysis is integrated into the
                label updating process, which is based on vertex similarity.
                Second, parallel propagation steps are comprehensively studied to
                utilize parallel computation power efficiently. Third, randomness
                in label updating is significantly reduced via automatic label
                selection and label weight thresholding. Experiments conducted on
                artificial and real social networks demonstrate that the proposed
                algorithm is scalable and exhibits high clustering accuracy.},

    abstract = { This article investigates how disinformation circulates on
                social media as adversarial narratives embedded in
                identity-driven controversies. Empirically, the article reports
                on the flat Earth echo chamber on YouTube, a controversial group
                arguing that the earth is a plane, not a sphere. By analyzing how
                they weave their arguments, this study demonstrates that
                disinformation circulates through identity-based grievances. As
                grudges intensify, back-and-forth argumentation becomes a form of
                knowing that solidifies viewpoints. Moreover, the argument
                resists fact-checking because it stokes the contradictions of
                identity work through grievances (pathos) and group
                identification (ethos). The conceptual contribution proposes a
                two-phase framework for how disinformation circulates on social
                media. The first phase, “seeding,” is when malicious actors
                strategically insert deceptions by masquerading their legitimacy
                (e.g., fake news). The second phase, “echoing,” enlists
                participants to cocreate the contentious narratives that
                disseminate disinformation. A definition of disinformation is
                proposed: Disinformation is an adversarial campaign that
                weaponizes multiple rhetorical strategies and forms of
                knowing—including not only falsehoods but also truths,
                half-truths, and value-laden judgments—to exploit and amplify
                identity-driven controversies. Finally, the paper has
                implications for policy makers in handling the spread of
                disinformation on social media. },

                network is an important task in social network analysis. To solve
                this problem, many community detection algorithms for the full
                topology of an original social network have been proposed.
                However, these algorithms are not very effective at analyzing
                large-scale social networks. To overcome this deficiency, this
                paper proposes a community detection algorithm based on graph
                compression. Specifically, a compressed graph is first obtained
                by iteratively merging vertices with a degree of 1 or 2 into
                their neighbors with a higher degree. Then, two indices, i.e.,
                the density and quality of vertices, are defined to evaluate the
                probability of vertices as community seeds. By considering these
                two measures together, in a compressed social network, the number
                of communities and the corresponding initial community seeds are
                determined simultaneously. After obtaining the community
                structure of the compressed social network via seed expansion,
                the community results are propagated to the original social
                network. Extensive experiments conducted on various social
                networks have demonstrated the superiority of our proposal
                compared to several existing state-of-the-art community detection
                algorithms.},
