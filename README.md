## Abstract 

YouTube is the largest video streaming platform on the web, attracting billions of users 
daily who watch and engage with content through comments. 
A significant portion of these users consist of children and teenagers, who frequently interact 
with one another in the comment sections, forming active communities. 
However, these communities can also experience negative interactions between users, 
including instances of online bullying.
To explore these communities, we used the YouTube Data API v3 to collect comments 
from videos produced by creators targeting this demographic. We used these comments to construct 
co-commenter networks.
We then applied topic modeling and sentiment analysis to gain deeper insights into the  
content and dynamics within these communities.
This study identified distinct community patterns. Smaller communities 
demonstrated stronger internal connections, while larger networks showed weaker ties. The analysis 
uncovered two significant findings: one community showing coordinated negative behavior, and 
another revealing signs of targeted youth advertising practices.
