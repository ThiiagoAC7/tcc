# Identifying (deep) fake news communities on multiple social networks

> Thiago Amado Costa

## TODO:

- [] review on echo chambers (graph based community identification)
- [] Pensar em um caminho a partir de um artigo de interesse:
   -  Replicar a metodologia com outro contexto/dataset
   -  Estender as análises de um artigo de interesse, por exemplo, agregando outros datasets como o NOW Corpus
