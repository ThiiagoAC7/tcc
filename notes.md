## Methodology

- [Topic Modeling to identify Abusive comments](./refs/Utilizing_Topic_Modelling_To_Identify_Abusive_Comments_On_YouTube.pdf)
    ![meth](./refs/meth.png) 
    - We have used LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) to identify dominant topics in a particular 
    uploaderâ€™s comment section. 
    - We have also used the TextBlob library of python for determining the polarity and 
    subjectivity of comments for each uploader.

## COMMENTER NETWORKS (COMUNIDADES)
- [Commenter Behavior Characterization on YouTube Channels](./refs/comment_behaviour_characterization.pdf)
    - introduz o conceito de co-commenter networks
    - For each channel, a co-commenter network is created where edges represent commenters who 
    have commented on the same video. 
    The weight of the edge indicates the number of videos they have co-commented on.
