# DeepFakE: improving fake news detection using tensor decomposition‑based deep neural network

## TODO:
- [] see Section 2 related work/social-context based
- [] see Section 3 
- [] see Future works 
    - pode ser exatamente oque eu quero fazer
    - Real-time text-based classification of news articles by utilizing 
    these content and context-based features for the real-world dataset (graph-based)


## ECHO CHAMBERS
- news articles are shared within echo chambers
- user connected in the form of a [community](./community_structures.md)
- idea : utilize this kind of echo chambers to obtain user-related and community-related
information from the news articles
- 3 mode tensor : content, context and user-community
    - user-community : news-user engagement combined with community information


## News
- users with the same interests are aggregated together in social circles, and the 
opposing ideas are rejected and disapproved by the majority.
- perspectives for examining a news article:
    - news content based
        - knowledge-based 
        - style-based
